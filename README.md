# Real State Insights: Housing Price Analysis

## Overview

**Real State Insights: Housing Price Analysis** is a data science project focused on understanding and predicting housing prices. The project involves data gathering, wrangling, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a real estate dataset. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used for feature selection, followed by univariate and bivariate statistical studies on the principal features. The project employs machine learning models, including Random Forest Regressor and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to build predictive models.

## Project Structure

- **Data Gathering:** Collected a diverse real estate dataset, ensuring it contains all relevant features needed for analysis and modeling.
- **Data Wrangling & Cleaning:** Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, handling missing values, outliers, and data normalization.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted a detailed analysis to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships within the data.
- **Feature Selection (PCA):** Applied PCA to reduce dimensionality and identify the most significant features affecting housing prices.
- **Statistical Study:** Performed univariate and bivariate analyses on the principal features to understand their impact on housing prices.
- **Modeling:** Implemented machine learning models:
  - **Random Forest Regressor**
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Evaluation:** Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.
